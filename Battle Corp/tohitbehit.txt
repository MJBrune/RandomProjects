--==Physical attacks==--

Can only do physical attacks from the front of a mech, only at 1 range.

Kicking (roll normal to-hit +2)

Does half the damage that the kicking mech has in points (light = 5, medium = 7, heavy = 10)
Kicking hit location table (1-5 = Left leg, 6-10 = right leg, 11 = torso)

Charge attack (roll normal to-hit +3)

Does half the damage that the charging mech has in points (light = 5, medium = 7, heavy = 10) + 1dmg per hex traveled.
Uses the normal hit location table
Charging mech takes half the damage that the charging mech has in points to its torso for a sucessfull charge.


--==Falling==--

Taken 15 points of damage in 1 turn (1-5 falls, 6-11 stays up)
moving into rocks         (1-4 falls, 5-11 stays up)
Fails the physical attack roll (1-4 falls, 5-11 stays up)

--==If fails the fall roll==--

Roll facing direction (1 = where you were facing, 2-3 = 1 turn to the right, 4-5 = 2 turns to the right, 6-7 = facing backwards, 8-9 = 2 turns to the left, 10-11 = 1 turn to the left)

Falling damage is baised on half the points the mech has, (light = 5, medium = 7, heavy = 10), and is rolled on the hit location table.

--==Hit location table==--

Cockpit 11
Torso 9-10
Right arm 7-8
Left arm 5-6
Right leg 3-4
Left leg 1-2

--==Damage overflow==--

R/L leg ==> Torso
R/L Arm ==> Torso

---==Mech death==--

Losing the Cockpit, or the Torso

A mech can still operate without limbs, but if it has no weapons, they loose.  Legs are weapons.

--==Loosing limbs==--

Losing a leg = instant fall.
Losing an arm = loses the weapons in that arm.

--==Critical hits==--

Always a possible critical hit if 11 is rolled when rolling to hit. (Roll for location, then roll if critical 10-11)
-Cockpit critical = Pilot death.
-Torso critical = Engine explosion.
-R/L arm critical = A weapon in that limb destroyed.
-R/L leg critical = -1 movement point.
